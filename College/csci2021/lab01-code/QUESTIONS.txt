Answer the questions below according to the lab specification. Write
your answers directly in this text file and submit it to complete the
lab.


PROBLEM 1 `age.c'
=================

A
~

  Examine the source code for `age.c'. Compile it using the following
  invocation of `gcc'
  ,----
  | gcc age.c
  `----
  This should create the executable `a.out'. Run this program using the
  invocation.
  ,----
  | ./a.out
  `----
  Perform several runs of the program with the following values and
  paste your output in the space below.
  - Enter 16 : You are 8409600 minutes old. You're too young to do anything fun.
  - Enter 18 : You are 9460800 minutes old. You can vote but cannot legally imbibe alcohol.
                I bet that hasn't stopped you from trying though...
  - Enter 25 : You are 13140000 minutes old. You may imbibe alcohol but cannot be president.
  - Enter 44 : You are 23126400 minutes old. You may imbibe alcohol but cannot be president.


B

  Analyze the code for `age.c' and describe a flaw in the conditional
  structure towards the end that prevents the output:
  ,----
  | You can vote, drink, and be president.
  | Try all three at once!
  `----
  from being printed.

  It says that anything greater than 21 returns "You may imbibe alcohol but cannot be president."
  so the code never reaches the point of the last statement because it returns at the one before it.

  Alter the code to fix this bug so that for ages 35 and larger, the
  above text is printed. Paste your fixed code for the conditional below
  and test it by recompiling and showing a demo run.

  else if( age_years >= 21 && age_years < 35 ){
    printf("You may imbibe alcohol but cannot be president\n");
  }
  else if (age_years >= 35 ){                        // does this print?
    printf("You can vote, drink, and be president.\nTry all three at once!\n");
  }

  Enter 44 : You are 23126400 minutes old. You can vote, drink, and be president.
             Try all three at once!


C
~

  Attempt to enter some absurd ages for the age computation.
  - Enter 5000
  - Enter -5000
  Describe anything strange that seems to be happening based your
  understanding of how basic arithmetic is supposed to work.

  If you happen to know WHY this strangeness is happening, describe it
  below.  If not, you will find out soon.

  It seems that the int goes to 16 bits and then it overflows and wraps around.
  If we take 16 bits, the maximum representable value is 65535, and 65535/16 is
  4095, which is why 5000 wraps around.


D
~

  Describe which function is used to print information to the screen.
  Describe how it seems to work to substitute values into output and
  what *format specifier* indicates an integer should be substituted.

  The printf function is used to print information to the screen, the format
  specifier is %d for an integer. It also uses %f for a float and %s for an
  array of characters, plus more. The letter that follows the percent sign tells
  c which data type to print.


E
~

  Describe what function is used to read typed input interactively from
  a user in the `age.c' program.  Describe anything that seems strange
  about this function or its arguments.

  We will learn in not long why this bit of strangeness is necessary.

  The scanf function is used to read typed input. It also uses the % symbol
  to talk about the data type and then it points to the data that is at age_years.


PROBLEM 2 Collatz
=================

A
~

  Examine and compile the code associated with the collatz
  program. There are three files associated with this program.
  - `collatz_funcs.c' which defines two utility functions for computing
    the Collatz sequence
  - `collatz_main.c' which defines a `main()' function to compute a
    Collatz sequence
  - `collatz.h' header file which declares functions in
    `collatz_funcs.c' so that they are known to `collatz_main.c'

  To compile the program, use the following invocation of `gcc'
  ,----
  | gcc -o collatz collatz_funcs.c collatz_main.c
  `----
  This should create the program `collatz' which can be run with
  ,----
  | ./collatz
  `----

  Do so and enter inputs
  - Starting integer 7
  - Show output: 1

  Paste the output below.

Step 0: 7
Step 1: 22
Step 2: 11
Step 3: 34
Step 4: 17
Step 5: 52
Step 6: 26
Step 7: 13
Step 8: 40
Step 9: 20
Step 10: 10
Step 11: 5
Step 12: 16
Step 13: 8
Step 14: 4
Step 15: 2
Step 16: 1



B
~

  Determine what the "dash-O" option used above for `gcc -o' does. For
  example, what happens if one runs
  ,----
  | gcc -o GLIPGLOP collatz_funcs.c collatz_main.c
  `----
  instead.  You may wish to use the `ls' command to list the files in
  the current directory.

  Theres a GLIPGLOP file in the directory that I can't open.

  Describe what happens if you omit this option `-o' when compiling as
  in
  ,----
  | gcc collatz_funcs.c collatz_main.c
  `----
The code doesn't compile.

C
~

  Attempt to compile only the file `collatz_main.c' by doing
  ,----
  | gcc -o something collatz_main.c
  `----

  This should result in an error. Show the output of that error and
  determine why the compilation fails.

  \/tmp/ccmuJNq2.o: In function `main':
collatz_main.c:(.text+0x4d): undefined reference to `collatz_next'
collatz_main.c:(.text+0x9e): undefined reference to `collatz_steps'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

In collatz_main, we include collatz.h and we didn't compile that with it, so
there was an undefined reference to collatz_next and collatz_steps, which is in
collatz.funcs.


D
~

  Attempt to compile only the file `collatz_funcs.c' by doing
  ,----
  | gcc -o something collatz_funcs.c
  `----

  This should result in an error. Show the output of that error and
  determine why the compilation fails.

/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o: In function `_start':
(.text+0x20): undefined reference to `main'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

This fails because there is an undefined reference to main which is in collatz_main
which we didn't compile with the file.
