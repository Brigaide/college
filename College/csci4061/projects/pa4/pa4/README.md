How to compile:
-Open two terminals.
-In terminal 1, navigate inside the PA4_Server folder.
-To compile, simply type make in the terminal.
-If compilation is successful, you may now run the server side by typing in
  ./server <Server Port>
-The server side is up and running if you see 'server is listening' after.

-In terminal 2, navigate inside the PA4_Server folder.
-To compile, simply type make in the terminal.
-If compilation is successful, you may now run the server side by typing in
  ./client <Folder Name> <# of Mappers> <Server IP> <Server Port>
-This will execute the program.
-You will find server output on the terminal and client output in the
  "log_client.txt" file.
